Hey modders!

Modular Assemblies is a mod framework designed to put the 'Engineer' back into 'Space Engineers'. It provides a simpler method of creating multiblock structures that provide added functionality, without killing performance or using esoteric vanilla tools.

This is the base mod, and must be referenced as a dependency for client mods. [Check out the wiki](https://github.com/StarCoreSE/Modular-Assemblies/wiki) for more information and guides.
Feel free to message [@aristeas.] [on the StarCore discord](https://discord.gg/starcore) if you have any questions, comments, or concerns.
