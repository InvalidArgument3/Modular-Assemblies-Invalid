Hey modders!

This is a bit of a mess, so please bear with me. Ping [@aristeas.] on discord if you have any questions, comments, or concerns.

Modular Assemblies is the base mod, and must be referenced as a dependency for client mods. [Check out the wiki](https://github.com/StarCoreSE/Modular-Assemblies/wiki) for more information and guides.
